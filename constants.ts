**Slide 4: Daily Tasks and Activities**
- **Cross-Docking Operations:**
    - **Role:** Supervised the transfer of goods directly from inbound to outbound trucks on warehouse ramps or in the open yard.
    - **Impact:** This process minimizes storage time and handling, significantly speeding up the supply chain for time-sensitive goods.
- **LCL Export (Less than Container Load):**
    - **Role:** Managed the entire lifecycle of LCL shipments. This included customs verification for compliance, receiving goods from various clients, and safely storing them.
    - **Technology:** Utilized handheld RF (Radio Frequency) scanner devices to process outbound goods, ensuring real-time inventory accuracy and efficient order picking.
- **DC Storage (Distribution Center):**
    - **Inbound:** Managed the receiving of goods, assigning barcodes, and scanning them into the warehouse management system with RF devices for accurate tracking.
    - **Outbound:** Verified outbound shipments against detailed checklists, ensuring order accuracy. Conducted critical pre-loading inspections of containers to check for structural damage, cleanliness, and security.
- **Open Yard Operations:**
    - **Role:** Handled specialized vehicle logistics.
    - **Tasks:** Verified insurance policy numbers for incoming vehicles. Performed detailed inspections of zero-mileage cars for any transit damages. Cross-referenced brand-new vehicles against inventory lists to confirm all standard items (like spare tires, tool kits) were present.

**Slide 5: Project Overview - Designing a Staging Area for DC2 Warehouse**
- **Problem Statement:** The DC2 warehouse experienced operational bottlenecks during peak loading and unloading times. Goods were often placed haphazardly, leading to congestion, safety risks, and delays.
- **Goal:** To design and implement a dedicated, clearly marked staging area for the DC2 Warehouse.
- **The Solution:** The project involved analyzing workflow, mapping forklift and personnel movement, and designating specific floor-marked zones for inbound and outbound goods.
- **Key Benefits:**
    - **Efficiency (Faster Loading/Unloading):** By pre-arranging and organizing goods in the staging area before trucks arrive, the loading and unloading processes become significantly faster, improving vehicle turnaround time.
    - **Quality Control:** The staging area provides a dedicated space for thorough checks. This is where staff can easily identify damages, count items to find shortages, and verify documentation without pressure or congestion.
    - **Safety and Organization:** A designated staging area drastically reduces clutter on the main warehouse floor. It creates clear, safe pathways for forklifts and pedestrian workers, minimizing the risk of accidents.

**Slide 6: Project Result**
- **Outcome:** A formal staging area for the DC2 Warehouse was successfully designed and demarcated.
- **Impact:**
    - The new system dramatically improved the organization and logical flow of goods within the warehouse.
    - It led to a more efficient utilization of floor space for both inbound and outbound operations.
    - Anecdotal feedback from the operations team indicated a roughly 15% reduction in truck loading times and fewer errors in order fulfillment.

**Slide 7: Conclusion**
- **Overall Impact:** The internship was a transformative professional experience.
- **Soft Skills Developed:** Greatly enhanced crucial soft skills like clear communication with team members and supervisors, effective teamwork in a fast-paced environment, and analytical problem-solving.
- **Professional Growth:** Learned to take ownership and responsibility for assigned tasks, manage time effectively to meet deadlines, and adapt to the dynamic challenges of a logistics hub.
- **Business Insight:** Gained a deep, practical understanding of how a large-scale logistics company operates, including inter-departmental collaboration, project management principles, and adherence to high professional and safety standards.
- **Summary:** The experience bridged the gap between academic theory and real-world application, improving both technical and interpersonal skills and providing a clear vision for a future career in logistics.
